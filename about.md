## How the World Environmental Performance Indexes Visualizer application works

There are three inputs that can be selected by the end users:

1. the Environmental Performance Index (EPI)
2. the regions classification type, determining the way countries are grouped in regions
3. the selection of a top-10 or a bottom-10 countries view

Three outputs are determined by above inputs selection:

1. the interactive map showing with gradient color scales the EPI values at country level
2. the table showing EPI values at region level, computed as average of the region member countries EPI's
3. the top-10/bottom-10 countries table as based on selected EPI metric
